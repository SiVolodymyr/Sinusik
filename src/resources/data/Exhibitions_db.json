            "In July 2012, during my time at university, I connected with fellow students who shared a passion for painting. We decided to organize a group exhibition showcasing our work. Although initially planned to include five artists, the event was delayed twice due to some of us not having enough work ready. In the end, three of us participated in the exhibition, which took place at the Cherkasy Regional Museum of Art. I presented 18 works created with watercolor and oil paints. It was a valuable experience that helped shape my early artistic career."
